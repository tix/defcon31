## Installation

Install this package via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
composer require stichoza/google-translate-php
```

> Note: **PHP 7.1 or later** is required. For older versoins, use `^3.2` version of this package (see [old docs](https://github.com/Stichoza/google-translate-php/tree/3.2#google-translate-php)).

## Basic Usage

Create GoogleTranslate object

```php
use Stichoza\GoogleTranslate\GoogleTranslate;

$tr = new GoogleTranslate('en'); // Translates into English
```
Or you can change languages later
```php
$tr = new GoogleTranslate(); // Translates to 'en' from auto-detected language by default
$tr->setSource('en'); // Translate from English
$tr->setSource(); // Detect language automatically
$tr->setTarget('ka'); // Translate to Georgian
```
Translate sentences
```php
echo $tr->translate('Hello World!');
```
Also, you can also use method chaining
```php
echo $tr->setSource('en')->setTarget('ka')->translate('Goodbye');
```
Or call a shorthand static method `trans`
```php
echo GoogleTranslate::trans('Hello again', 'ka', 'en');
```

## Advanced Usage

### Language Detection

To detect language automatically, just set the source language to `null`:

```php
$tr = new GoogleTranslate('es', null); // Or simply do not pass the second parameter 
```

```php
$tr->setSource(); // Another way
```

Use `getLastDetectedSource()` to get detected language:

```php
$tr = new GoogleTranslate('fr');

$text = $tr->translate('Hello World!');

echo $tr->getLastDetectedSource(); // Output: en
```

Return value will be `null` if the language couldn't be detected.

Supported languages are listed in [Google API docs](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages).

### Using Raw Response

For advanced usage, you might need the raw results that Google Translate provides. you can use `getResponse` method for that.

```php
$responseArray = $tr->getResponse('Hello world!');
```

### Custom URL

You can override the default Google Translate url by `setUrl` method. Useful for some countries

```php
$tr->setUrl('http://translate.google.cn/translate_a/single'); 
```

### HTTP Client Configuration

This package uses [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) for HTTP requests. You can pass an array of [guzzle client configuration options](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/request-options.html) as a third parameter to `GoogleTranslate` constructor, or just use `setOptions` method.

You can configure proxy, user-agent, default headers, connection timeout and so on using this options.

```php
$tr = new GoogleTranslate('en', 'ka', [
    'timeout' => 10,
    'proxy' => [
        'http'  => 'tcp://localhost:8125',
        'https' => 'tcp://localhost:9124'
    ],
    'headers' => [
        'User-Agent' => 'Foo/5.0 Lorem Ipsum Browser'
    ]
]);
```

```php
// Set proxy to tcp://localhost:8090
$tr->setOptions(['proxy' => 'tcp://localhost:8090'])->translate('Hello');

// Set proxy to socks5://localhost:1080
$tr->setOptions(['proxy' => 'socks5://localhost:1080'])->translate('World');
```

For more information, see [Creating a Client](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html#creating-a-client) section in Guzzle docs (6.x version).

### Custom Token Generator

You can override the token generator class by passing a generator object as a fourth parameter of constructor or just use `setTokenProvider` method.

Generator must implement `Stichoza\GoogleTranslate\Tokens\TokenProviderInterface`.

```php
use Stichoza\GoogleTranslate\Tokens\TokenProviderInterface;

class MyTokenGenerator implements TokenProviderInterface
{
    public function generateToken(string $source, string $target, string $text) : string
    {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

And use:

```php
$tr->setTokenProvider(new MyTokenGenerator);
```

### Translation Client (Quality)

Google Translate has a parameter named `client` which defines quality of translation. First it was set to `webapp` but later google added `gtx` value which results in a better translation quality in terms of grammar and overall meaning of sentences.

You can use `->setClient()` method to switch between clients. For example if you want to use older version of translation algorithm, type `$tr->setClient('webapp')->translate('lorem ipsum...')`. Default value is `gtx`.

### Errors and Exception Handling

Static method `trans()` and non-static `translate()` and `getResponse()` will throw following Exceptions:

 - `ErrorException` If the HTTP request fails for some reason.
 - `UnexpectedValueException` If data received from Google cannot be decoded.

In addition, `translate()` and `trans()` methods will return `null` if there is no translation available.

## Known Limitations
 
 - `503 Service Unavailable` response:
   If you are getting this error, it is most likely that Google has banned your external IP address and/or [requires you to solve a CAPTCHA](https://github.com/Stichoza/google-translate-php/issues/18). This is not a bug in this package. Google has become stricter, and it seems like they keep lowering the number of allowed requests per IP per a certain amount of time. Try sending less requests to stay under the radar, or change your IP frequently ([for example using proxies](#http-client-configuration)). Please note that once an IP is banned, even if it's only temporary, the ban can last from a few minutes to more than 12-24 hours, as each case is different.
 - `429 Too Many Requests` response:
   This error is basically the same as explained above.
 - `413 Request Entity Too Large` response:
   This error means that your input string is too long. Google only allows a maximum of 5000 characters to be translated at once. If you want to translate a longer text, you can split it to shorter parts, and translate them one-by-one.
 - `403 Forbidden` response:
   This is not an issue with this package. Google Translate itself has some problems when it comes to translating some characters and HTML entities. See https://github.com/Stichoza/google-translate-php/issues/119#issuecomment-558078133
